            <h2 class="essay-section-title">What Capital Diligence Is</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>Capital diligence, as we practice it, is structural analysis conducted on behalf of investors before capital changes hands. It is not legal diligence, which examines contracts and compliance. It is not financial diligence, which reconciles numbers and validates accounting. It is an examination of how a business is actually built—its architecture, its position in value chains, its dependencies, and its constraints.</p>
              <p>The question we try to answer is not whether the numbers are accurate, but whether the business makes sense. Does its cost structure support its stated strategy? Does its competitive position justify its valuation assumptions? Are the risks that matter actually visible in the materials provided, or do they sit elsewhere?</p>
              <p>This work exists because there is a gap between what transaction processes produce and what investors need to know. The materials prepared for fundraising are designed to persuade. The analysis we provide is designed to clarify. These are different objectives, and they produce different outputs.</p>

            <h2 class="essay-section-title">Where Risk Actually Hides</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>Most investment risk is discussed in terms of market conditions, competition, and execution. These are real risks, but they are also the risks that everyone sees. The risks that damage investors tend to be structural—embedded in how a business is built rather than how it is operated.</p>
              <p>A business may be growing quickly while its unit economics are structurally inverted. A company may have strong margins while its position in the value chain is eroding beneath it. A founder may be executing well while the capital structure creates pressures that will eventually force suboptimal decisions. These risks are not hidden in the sense of being concealed. They are hidden in the sense of being structural—visible only if you know where to look.</p>
              <p>We have found that the most consequential risks are often the ones that feel like features. The aggressive growth that signals momentum may also signal unsustainable customer acquisition costs. The lean team that signals efficiency may also signal an inability to scale. The capital efficiency that signals discipline may also signal underinvestment in defensibility. Reading these signals correctly requires structural analysis, not pattern matching.</p>

            <h2 class="essay-section-title">What BACKGRND Evaluates</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>We examine the architecture of the business: how value is created, where costs accumulate, what drives margins, and how the pieces fit together. We trace the logic from strategy to structure, looking for alignment and contradiction.</p>
              <p>We map the value chain: where the business sits relative to suppliers, customers, and adjacent players; where power concentrates; where value leaks; and how these dynamics are likely to evolve. A strong business in a weak position is a different investment than it appears.</p>
              <p>We assess the capital structure: not just how much has been raised, but on what terms, with what implications, and with what constraints on future decisions. Capital structure is often treated as a financing detail. We treat it as a strategic fact.</p>
              <p>We consider time: whether the assumptions embedded in the business model require conditions that are likely to persist, and whether the time horizon of the investment matches the time horizon of the opportunity. Many investments fail not because the thesis was wrong, but because the timing was misaligned.</p>

            <h2 class="essay-section-title">When Investors Engage</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>Investors typically engage us when they have already decided to look closely at something. The initial screening is done. The opportunity appears interesting. What remains is the question of whether the structure supports the story.</p>
              <p>Some engage before term sheets, wanting structural clarity before committing to a valuation. Others engage after terms are agreed but before closing, using our analysis as a final check. A smaller number engage post-investment, when something feels wrong but the source is unclear.</p>
              <p>We are not a substitute for the investor's own judgment. We do not recommend whether to invest. We provide analysis that informs judgment, written plainly enough that the investor can reason from it directly. The decision remains with the principal.</p>

          <section class="essay-section">
            <h2 class="essay-section-title">Typical Outputs</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>Our deliverable is a written memo. Not a slide deck, not a spreadsheet model, not a summary with appendices. A memo—structured prose that walks through what we found, what it means, and what questions it raises.</p>
              <p>The memo is written for the principal, not for a committee or a file. It assumes intelligence and context. It does not repeat information the investor already has. It focuses on what our analysis adds: structural observations that were not visible in the materials provided, questions that were not asked, risks that were not surfaced.</p>
              <p>We do not produce scores, rankings, or recommendations. We do not tell investors what to do. We tell them what we see, as clearly as we can, and leave the interpretation to them. This is a feature of how we work, not a limitation.</p>

            <h2 class="essay-section-title">What This Is Not</h2>
            <div class="essay-section-body">
              <p>This is not due diligence in the legal or accounting sense. We do not verify representations, audit financials, or assess regulatory compliance. Those functions require different expertise and different access than we have or seek.</p>
              <p>This is not deal advisory. We do not help investors win deals, negotiate terms, or structure transactions. We have no interest in whether a transaction closes. Our analysis is the same whether the investor proceeds or walks away.</p>
              <p>This is not ongoing monitoring or portfolio support. We engage around specific decisions, produce our analysis, and step back. We do not maintain relationships with portfolio companies or provide follow-on services. Each engagement is discrete.</p>
              <p>This is not a product or a platform. We do not have a methodology that we apply uniformly, a database that we query, or a process that we scale. Each engagement is custom work, shaped by the specific business and the specific questions the investor is asking.</p>
