              <p>
                We are often asked about our process. The question assumes that
                process is a stable thing—a set of steps to be followed. Our
                experience suggests otherwise.
              </p>

              <p>
                What we have is less a process than a set of questions we return
                to repeatedly. Some are general: What do we know? What do we
                think we know but actually do not? What would change our mind?
                Some are specific to the situation at hand.
              </p>

              <p>
                The value of these questions lies not in their novelty—they are
                ordinary questions—but in the discipline of returning to them.
                It is easy, in the flow of analysis, to lose sight of what one
                is actually trying to determine.
              </p>

              <p>
                We keep extensive notes. Not summaries or conclusions, but the
                raw material of thought: observations, questions,
                contradictions, confusions. These notes are not for others; they
                are for ourselves, to be revisited when memory fades or
                circumstances change.
              </p>

              <p>
                The discipline of writing is central to our process, such as it
                is. Writing forces precision that speaking does not. It exposes
                gaps in reasoning that conversation conceals. We distrust
                conclusions that cannot survive the discipline of being written
                down.
              </p>

              <p>
                This memo is itself an example. The act of articulating our view
                on process has forced us to examine that view more closely than
                we otherwise would. We are not certain it will survive the
                examination.
