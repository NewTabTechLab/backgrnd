                Most market participants operate on remarkably similar time
                horizons. Quarterly earnings, annual reviews, three-year fund
                cycles—these rhythms create structural opportunity for those
                willing to extend their frame of reference.
              </p>

              <p>
                Time arbitrage is not merely patience, though patience is
                required. It is the willingness to take positions that may
                appear wrong for extended periods before proving right. This
                requires not just conviction but also constituents who share
                that time horizon.
              </p>

              <p>
                The challenge is both psychological and structural.
                Psychologically, it is difficult to maintain conviction when
                interim results suggest error. Structurally, most capital is
                subject to review cycles that punish short-term underperformance
                regardless of long-term merit.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have attempted to address both challenges. Psychologically,
                through process: decisions are documented with explicit time
                horizons and expected interim patterns. When results match our
                expected interim pattern, even if that pattern is negative, we
                view this as confirmation rather than refutation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Structurally, through alignment: our capital base is composed of
                partners who understand and share our time horizon. We have
                deliberately remained small to preserve this alignment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Time arbitrage is not a strategy that scales. Its very
                effectiveness depends on most capital being unable or unwilling
                to operate on extended horizons. We are comfortable with this
                constraint.
