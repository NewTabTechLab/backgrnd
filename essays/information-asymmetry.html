                Notes on Information Asymmetry

            <div class="essay-article-body">
              <p>
                The traditional view holds that information asymmetry is an edge
                to be exploited. We take a different view: in most markets, the
                asymmetry that matters is not informational but interpretive.
              </p>

              <p>
                Consider: the same quarterly report is available to all market
                participants at precisely the same moment. The data is
                symmetric. What differs is interpretation—what questions each
                reader brings to the data, what frameworks they use to process
                it, what conclusions they draw.
              </p>

              <p>
                This suggests that the pursuit of informational edge, while not
                without merit, is often misallocated effort. The more
                interesting question is: given the same information, how might
                one think about it differently?
              </p>

              <p>
                Interpretive asymmetry is not easily acquired. It requires
                building mental models over time, through experience and study.
                It requires developing a point of view on how systems work—not
                just how they appear to work.
              </p>

              <p>
                We invest considerable time in developing these interpretive
                frameworks. They are not proprietary in any legal sense—anyone
                could, in principle, arrive at similar views through similar
                effort. But the effort is non-trivial, and that creates the
                asymmetry.
              </p>

              <p>
                The implication for our practice is clear: we spend relatively
                little time gathering information that others do not have, and
                relatively more time developing views that others do not hold.
                This is not a faster path to returns. It is, we believe, a more
                durable one.
