              <p>
                Most businesses do not fail because of a lack of effort,
                intelligence, or intent.<br />They fail because they were
                designed to behave poorly once time, capital, or complexity
                entered the system.
              </p>

              <p>
                Early decisions—often made under pressure, optimism, or
                incomplete information—quietly determine where power sits, how
                value accumulates, and which problems become permanent later.
                These decisions are rarely revisited, not because they are
                correct, but because they become embedded.
              </p>

              <p>Structure precedes performance.</p>

              <p>
                Execution does not compensate for weak structure. It merely
                exposes it faster. What appears to be a problem of leadership,
                culture, or strategy is often a consequence of architectural
                choices made long before those symptoms surfaced.
              </p>

              <p>
                Many businesses look functional in their early years. Revenue
                grows. Teams expand. Activity increases. Yet beneath the
                surface, value may be accumulating elsewhere—upstream suppliers,
                downstream platforms, or intermediaries with stronger control
                positions. Over time, the business works harder for diminishing
                returns, mistaking motion for progress.
              </p>

              <p>Structural failure is delayed failure.</p>

              <p>
                By the time distress becomes visible, the causes are already
                locked in: incentive misalignment, fragile margins, decision
                bottlenecks, capital dependency, or control structures that
                cannot absorb stress. At that point, correction becomes
                expensive, political, or impossible.
              </p>

              <p>This is why BACKGRND works upstream.</p>

              <p>
                The goal is not to optimise performance, but to understand how a
                business is designed to behave under pressure—before pressure
                arrives. Structure does not guarantee success, but weak
                structure guarantees constraint.
              </p>

              <p>Most failures are not sudden.<br />They are architectural.</p>
