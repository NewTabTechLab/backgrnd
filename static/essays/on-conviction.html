            <p>The distinction between confidence and conviction is often blurred. Confidence is a feeling; conviction is a position. One can be confident without being right, and one can hold conviction without certainty. The difference lies in the foundation upon which each rests.</p>

            <p>Confidence tends to emerge from pattern recognition—having seen something work before, we expect it to work again. It is extrapolative by nature. Conviction, by contrast, is more deliberate. It requires not just observation but reasoning. It asks not "has this worked?" but "why would this work?"</p>

            <p>In capital allocation, the distinction matters considerably. Confidence alone can lead to overcommitment in familiar territories while missing entirely the new. Conviction, built on first principles, allows for positions that may appear contrarian but are in fact simply reasoned.</p>

            <p>We find that conviction is best developed slowly. It is not the product of a single meeting or memorandum, but of sustained attention to a question. The most durable convictions we hold are those we have tested repeatedly—not through affirmation, but through active skepticism.</p>

            <p>This is why we tend to move slowly. Speed and conviction are not natural partners. The pressure to deploy capital quickly often produces confidence masquerading as conviction. We prefer to wait.</p>

            <p>The cost of waiting is real—missed opportunities accumulate. But the cost of acting on confidence rather than conviction is higher still. A portfolio built on conviction can withstand doubt; one built on confidence cannot.</p>
