          <h2 class="memo-heading">How We Approach Businesses</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>We begin by understanding how a business is constructed. Not its narrative or positioning, but its actual architecture—how costs flow, where margins accumulate, what constrains growth, and where dependencies lie.</p>
            <p>This is slower work than most expect. It requires reading across documents that were never meant to be read together, asking questions that reveal assumptions rather than answers, and sitting with ambiguity longer than is comfortable.</p>
            <p>The output is not a recommendation. It is a clearer picture of what is actually there, written plainly enough that principals can reason from it directly.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="business-design-architecture" class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Business Design & Architecture</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Every business has a design, whether deliberate or emergent. We examine that design: how the company creates value, captures it, and defends it. We look at cost structures not as line items but as expressions of strategic choice. We trace revenue streams back to their structural sources.</p>
            <p>This work is particularly useful when a business has grown faster than its founders' understanding of it, or when outside capital is being considered and the principals want an independent view of what they actually have.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="value-chain-intelligence" class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Value Chain Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Businesses exist within chains of activity that extend far beyond their own operations. We map these chains—upstream to suppliers and inputs, downstream to customers and end users, laterally to adjacent players who shape the competitive environment.</p>
            <p>The purpose is not to produce a diagram, but to surface the points of leverage and vulnerability that are often invisible from inside the business. Where does power concentrate? Where is value leaking? Where are the chokepoints that could become strategic?</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="business-diagnostics" class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Business Diagnostics</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Sometimes a business is underperforming against its own potential, and the reasons are not obvious. We conduct diagnostic work to identify structural impediments—misalignments between strategy and operations, pricing that contradicts positioning, cost structures that have drifted from their original logic.</p>
            <p>This is forensic work. We are not looking for quick wins or obvious inefficiencies. We are looking for the deeper patterns that explain why a business behaves the way it does, especially when that behaviour is frustrating to those who run it.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="domain-architecture" class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Domain Architecture</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Certain industries and sectors have structural characteristics that shape all businesses within them. We study these domains—their economics, their regulatory contours, their competitive dynamics, their historical patterns of value creation and destruction.</p>
            <p>This work is useful for investors entering unfamiliar territory, for operators seeking to understand the constraints they are working within, and for anyone making a large commitment to a sector they have not yet fully mapped.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Capital Diligence</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Before capital changes hands—whether through investment, acquisition, or partnership—there is value in understanding what is actually being exchanged. We support principals with independent analysis that sits outside the transaction process itself.</p>
            <p>Our work here is not due diligence in the legal or accounting sense. It is structural diligence: an assessment of business architecture, competitive position, and value chain dynamics that informs the judgment of those with capital at stake.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="memo-section">
          <h2 class="memo-heading">Venture Studio</h2>
          <div class="memo-content">
            <p>Occasionally, our analysis reveals opportunities that do not yet have a business attached to them—gaps in value chains, structural shifts that create new openings, domains where architecture could be built differently.</p>
            <p>In these cases, we sometimes participate in building. This is not our primary work, and we are selective about when we engage. But we maintain the capacity to move from analysis to formation when the conditions are right and the principals are aligned.</p>

            <p class="closing-memo-text">This is the work we do. It is not comprehensive, and it is not for everyone. We are useful to those who have already decided to look closely at something, and who want an independent perspective before making decisions that are difficult to reverse.</p>
